Shadark: The Ocean's Obsidian Heart
Part 1: The Spreading Stain

The year is 2077. The oceans, humanity's last great frontier, are veined with deep-sea research stations, mining colonies, and the shimmering trails of ultra-fast submersible transit tubes. Yet, for all this encroachment, the abyssal plains, the lightless trenches, remain largely a mystery, repositories of secrets ancient and profound. It was from these unplumbed depths that the first whispers of the Shadark began.

It started subtly, a statistical anomaly in the global shipping network. Vessels traversing the Ogasawara Trench, a particularly deep and geologically active gash in the Pacific floor, reported bizarre navigational errors. Their sophisticated guidance systems, reliant on a mesh of seabed beacons and quantum entanglement comms, would flicker and die, plunging them into analog navigation. Then came the comms blackouts – not sudden failures, but a creeping silence, as if the very airwaves were being absorbed.

The first ship to vanish was the Phosphor, a state-of-the-art benthic research vessel. One moment it was transmitting routine data from a depth of 7,000 meters, its array of lights cutting a swathe through the eternal night; the next, its signal simply ceased. No distress call, no debris field, no seismic anomaly. It was as if a colossal hand had reached out and plucked it from existence.

Three more followed within six months: a robotic ore hauler, a luxury deep-sea cruiser on its maiden voyage into the hadal zone, and a heavily shielded military sub on a classified patrol. The incidents were too precise, too clean. Piracy was ruled out; the depths were too extreme, the targets too diverse. Geological events were considered, but the lack of any corresponding seismic signature or wreckage made this unlikely.

Dr. Aris Thorne, a marine biologist with a controversial penchant for exploring the fringes of known science, was among the first to connect the disappearances with another, equally unsettling phenomenon: the "Shadow Blight." Patches of the ocean, sometimes hundreds of square kilometers in area, were experiencing a measurable dimming. Not a clouding of the water, but an actual reduction in ambient light, even light generated by bioluminescent organisms. Deep-sea cameras in these zones showed corals losing their faint glow, fish schooling in disoriented patterns, their own bioluminescence muted. The blight was spreading, an amorphous, light-devouring stain creeping across the abyssal plains.

Thorne, a man whose lean frame and intense, dark eyes gave him the perpetual look of someone who had just wrestled with an existential horror and barely won, had a theory. He spoke of it in hushed tones at sparsely attended academic conferences, his presentations filled with blurry satellite images of the expanding blight and complex equations attempting to model energy absorption on an unprecedented scale. Most dismissed him as an eccentric, his ideas too outlandish. But as the disappearances mounted, and the Shadow Blight encroached upon established deep-sea lanes and even the peripheries of submerged habitats, a few influential ears began to listen.

One such ear belonged to Admiral Eva Rostova, commander of the newly formed Pan-Pacific Deep Security Force (PDSF), a multinational organization tasked with protecting humanity’s burgeoning underwater interests. Rostova was a woman forged in the cold pressures of command, her silver hair cut short and severe, her gaze direct and uncompromising. She dealt in facts and strategic imperatives, not fanciful theories. Yet, the facts were becoming undeniably strange. The loss of the military sub, the Charon, was the final catalyst. Its last garbled transmission, cut short, spoke of an "impossible darkness" and "a shadow that swallows the light."

Rostova summoned Thorne to the PDSF's central command, a sprawling underwater facility known as Triton's Bastion, located near the Mariana Trench. The journey itself was a descent into another world. Thorne, strapped into a high-speed transit pod, watched the sunlit surface waters give way to the perpetual twilight of the mesopelagic zone, then the inky black of the bathyal, and finally, the crushing, alien darkness of the abyssopelagic. Triton's Bastion, a network of interconnected geodesic domes and towering spires, glowed with internal light, a defiant spark against the overwhelming pressure and blackness.

"Dr. Thorne," Rostova greeted him in her spartan office, the only adornment a vast, real-time holographic map of the Pacific showing known installations, transit routes, and, ominously, the spreading, amoeba-like patches of the Shadow Blight. "Your theories have, until recently, been considered... speculative. The current situation, however, demands we explore all avenues."

Thorne nodded, his gaze fixed on the hologram. "Admiral, what we are dealing with is not a geological event, nor is it a new form of energy weapon, as some have suggested. I believe we are facing an entity. A biological entity of unimaginable scale, whose very nature is intertwined with shadow."

Rostova raised a skeptical eyebrow. "A biological entity? Doctor, the energy readings alone from these… blights… are astronomical. To suggest an organism is responsible…"

"An organism that perhaps doesn't conform to our understanding of biology, Admiral," Thorne countered, his voice gaining intensity. "One that doesn't metabolize matter in the way we expect, but perhaps… energy. Or something even more fundamental. The ancient mariners had legends, you know. Not just of krakens and sea serpents, but of darknesses that lived. 'Umbras,' they called them. 'Light-eaters.' The Japanese spoke of 'Kagewani' – shadow sharks that consumed not the body, but the shadow, and with it, the being itself."

"Mythology is hardly actionable intelligence, Doctor."

"Perhaps," Thorne conceded. "But mythology often contains the echoes of forgotten truths. The 'impossible darkness' the Charon reported? The way the Phosphor and the others simply… ceased to be? It aligns with these ancient fears. Imagine a creature not just large, but whose very presence warps the local environment, draining light, draining energy, perhaps even draining the essence of what it encounters. A creature made of shadow, or that commands it." He paused, letting the immense implication hang in the sterile air of the office. "I call it the Shadark."

Rostova stared at the holographic map, her expression unreadable. The largest patch of the Shadow Blight, near the Ogasawara Trench, now spanned nearly five hundred kilometers. "And its size, Doctor? If your hypothesis holds?"

Thorne took a deep breath. "Based on the curvature of the blight's leading edges, the sheer volume of energy it seems to absorb, and the speed of its apparent movement… I can only offer a conservative estimate. We could be talking about something in the order of fifteen, perhaps even twenty thousand meters in length. Twenty kilometers."

The silence in the room became heavy, thick as the abyssal water outside. Rostova finally turned back to Thorne, her eyes narrowed in calculation. "Twenty kilometers. That's not a creature, Doctor. That's a mobile ecological disaster. A geological force with a life of its own."

"Precisely, Admiral," Thorne said grimly. "And it's heading towards the Izu-Bonin arc, directly threatening Station Hephaestus and the New Tokyo Sprawl's primary geothermal power conduits."

Rostova’s gaze hardened. Speculation had just become a strategic crisis. "If this 'Shadark' exists, Doctor, we need to understand it. And if it's a threat, we need to know how to neutralize it. You've studied it the most. What do you propose?"

Thorne had waited years for this question. "An expedition, Admiral. A dedicated vessel, equipped for extreme depth and prolonged operation, with a multidisciplinary team. We need to go into the blight. We need to find the source. We need to see the Shadark."

Part 2: The Obsidian Spearhead

The vessel commissioned for the unprecedented mission was named the Argus. It was less a ship and more a miniature, mobile arcology, a testament to humanity's engineering prowess when faced with the seemingly impossible. Over a kilometer in length, its sleek, obsidian hull was forged from a new generation of ceramic-metallic composites, designed to withstand pressures exceeding 1,500 atmospheres. Its heart was a compact fusion reactor that could power it for years, driving an array of silent, magnetohydrodynamic engines. The Argus wasn't built for speed, but for endurance, observation, and, if necessary, survival in an environment that defied terrestrial comprehension.

Its sensor suites were unparalleled: gravimetric imagers, quantum-entangled neutrino detectors, full-spectrum active and passive sonar capable of mapping square kilometers of seabed in exquisite detail, and a revolutionary "Chrono-Optical Deep Imager" (CODI) that, in theory, could reconstruct visual data from residual light particles, offering glimpses into areas of absolute darkness. It also carried three specialized submersibles: the Styx, a heavily shielded bathyscaphe for direct observation in hazardous conditions; the Lethe, a nimble, long-range scout; and the Mnemosyne, a deep-sea laboratory equipped for sample collection and analysis.

Leading the expedition was Captain Eva Rostova herself. The strategic implications were too vast, the potential threat too severe, for her to delegate command. Her XO was Commander Jian Li, a veteran submariner whose calm demeanor was legendary within the PDSF. Dr. Aris Thorne was, naturally, the chief scientific officer, heading a diverse team of specialists: Dr. Lena Hanson, a xenolinguist and expert in theoretical communication with non-human intelligence (a field considered even more fringe than Thorne’s); Dr. Kenji Tanaka, a geophysicist specializing in hadal zone tectonics and energy signatures; Elara Vance, a bio-ethicist and philosophical consultant whose inclusion raised many eyebrows but Rostova insisted upon, stating, "If we find something truly alien, we need to understand our own responsibilities"; and a grizzled, taciturn ex-special forces operative named Marcus "Anvil" Cole, head of security and submersible piloting, a man who had seen more than his share of darkness, both literal and metaphorical.

The crew numbered one hundred and fifty souls, each a handpicked expert in their field. The mood aboard the Argus as it slipped from its moorings at Triton's Bastion and began its multi-day descent towards the Ogasawara Trench was a mixture of grim determination and a palpable, electric excitement. They were venturing into the ultimate unknown, hunting a phantom that was rapidly becoming all too real.

"All systems nominal, Captain," Commander Li reported from the command deck, a vast, darkened amphitheater where holographic displays shimmered like captive nebulae, showing the Argus's trajectory, internal status, and the ever-encroaching boundary of the Shadow Blight. "ETA to Blight perimeter: 72 hours."

Rostova nodded, her gaze fixed on the main viewscreen, which currently showed only the oppressive, featureless black of the abyss. "Dr. Thorne, any new readings from the leading edge?"

Thorne, from his science station, adjusted his glasses. "The light absorption gradient is sharpening, Admiral. It's becoming more defined, less diffuse. Whatever the Shadark is, it appears to be… consolidating its influence as it moves. The localized energy drain is increasing exponentially. Bioluminescent life forms within ten kilometers of the perimeter are going completely dark within minutes of exposure."

"And the disappearances?"

"The commercial freighter Poseidon's Child was reported overdue three hours ago. Its last known position was directly in the Shadark's projected path, about two hundred kilometers ahead of us." Thorne's voice was flat, devoid of emotion, but his knuckles were white where he gripped his console.

A somber quiet settled over the command deck. The abstract threat was claiming tangible victims.

Over the next three days, the Argus pushed deeper into the Pacific's hadal zone, its powerful lights cutting swathes through water that had not seen the sun for millennia. They passed through landscapes of breathtaking desolation and bizarre beauty: vast plains of fine, dark silt; hydrothermal vent fields spewing superheated, mineral-rich water that supported unique ecosystems of giant tube worms and ghostly white crabs; and underwater mountain ranges whose peaks were lost in the darkness far above.

As they neared the coordinates of the Shadow Blight, the environment began to change in unsettling ways. The usually sparse but persistent bioluminescence of the deep faded. The water, though still clear, seemed to absorb the Argus's searchlights with an unnatural hunger, the beams petering out much sooner than calculations predicted. Sonar returns became oddly muffled, as if the sound waves themselves were being dampened.

"Entering the penumbra of the Blight now, Captain," Li announced, his voice a low rumble. The main viewscreen, despite the Argus's formidable illumination arrays, showed a deepening gloom. The edges of the screen seemed to fray into an impenetrable blackness.

"Dr. Thorne, your assessment?" Rostova asked, her eyes scanning the myriad data feeds.

"It's… remarkable," Thorne breathed, less with fear and more with a kind of awed horror. "The ambient light levels are dropping far more rapidly than anticipated. Our forward lumens are being… consumed. It's not just blocking light; it's actively negating it. The energy required for this is staggering."

"Can the CODI penetrate it?"

"Attempting now, Admiral," Thorne replied. He manipulated his controls, and a section of the main screen flickered, resolving into a grainy, monochromatic image. It was like looking through a storm of static, but faint, ghostly outlines could be discerned – the seabed, a distant, jagged ridge. "It's struggling. The very photons are scarce here. It’s like the laws of optics are being… bent."

Then, the first real tremor of fear rippled through the crew. The gravimetric sensors, designed to detect minute changes in local gravity fields, began to fluctuate wildly.

"Gravimetric distortion!" Tanaka yelled from his station, his usual composure shattered. "Massive, localized warping dead ahead! It's… it's off the scale! There's something there, something immense, but the sensors can't resolve its shape. It’s like a hole in spacetime."

On the main viewscreen, even the CODI’s struggling image began to fail, the static coalescing into an impenetrable, absolute blackness that seemed to bulge outwards, to press against the ship. It was no longer just an absence of light; it felt like a presence, a palpable entity of pure void.

"All stop!" Rostova commanded, her voice sharp. The Argus’s engines whined down, its immense bulk coming to a halt in the crushing darkness. The only light came from the ship's internal illumination, casting long, eerie shadows across the command deck. Outside, there was nothing. A perfect, suffocating black.

"What is that?" Li whispered, his eyes wide.

Before Thorne could answer, a new alarm blared – a chilling, rhythmic pulse.

"Proximity alert!" Cole barked from the security station. "Something… something is moving out there. Massive. Closing fast. But there's no sonar return, no heat signature… just the gravimetric displacement. It's like a ghost."

"Magnify the CODI, Thorne, maximum gain!" Rostova ordered.

The screen flickered, the static intensifying, and then, for a horrifying instant, an image resolved. It was not a clear picture, but a suggestion, a shape defined by the utter absence of even the faintest residual light. A colossal, flowing curve, like the leading edge of an impossibly vast fin, smooth and blacker than the void itself, slicing through the absolute darkness. It was so large that the Argus, a kilometer-long vessel, seemed like a minnow in its path. The scale was mind-shattering.

Then, just as quickly, the image was gone, swallowed by the overwhelming blackness. The proximity alarm shrieked, its pitch rising.

"It's beneath us!" Cole shouted. "The displacement field… it's passing directly under the hull!"

The Argus shuddered, a deep, groaning sound that vibrated through the decks. Lights flickered, and backup systems kicked in with a hum. On the holographic map, the patch of Shadow Blight they were in suddenly expanded, engulfing their position entirely.

"Report!" Rostova snapped, her knuckles white on the command chair's armrests.

"Minor hull stress, localized energy drain on the ventral plating, but she's holding," Li reported, his voice tight. "The… thing… whatever it was, it's passed. The gravimetric field is receding."

A collective, shaky breath was released on the command deck.

Thorne, however, was staring at his console, his face pale. "Admiral… the Poseidon's Child. I'm picking up its emergency beacon. Or what's left of it. It’s faint, distorted… and it’s coming from within the area the Shadark just traversed." He looked up, his eyes filled with a terrible understanding. "It didn't just pass it by. I think… I think the Shadark consumed it."

"Consumed?" Rostova questioned. "How?"

"The Kagewani legend, Admiral," Thorne said, his voice barely a whisper. "They ate the shadow, and the owner vanished. What if the Shadark doesn't consume matter in the conventional sense? What if it consumes… dimensionality? Existence itself, through its shadow?"

Elara Vance, the ethicist, who had been silent until now, spoke, her voice quiet but clear. "If a thing casts no shadow, does it truly exist in our light? What if this creature consumes the shadow, and the object, or person, is relegated to… elsewhere? Or nowhere?"

The implication was horrifying. They weren't just hunting a giant creature. They were hunting a mobile absence, a predator that operated on principles that threatened the very fabric of their reality. The silence that followed was broken only by the faint, rhythmic ping of the Poseidon's Child's dying beacon, a lonely heartbeat in the infinite, devouring darkness. The hunt had just become a desperate search for understanding, before they too became echoes in the shadow.

Part 3: Echoes in the Abyss

The Argus hung suspended in the heart of the Shadow Blight. Outside, the impenetrable darkness pressed in, a tangible entity that seemed to mock their most powerful lights. Inside, a grim council of war was underway in the briefing room. The holographic projector displayed the last known trajectory of the Poseidon's Child and the estimated path of the Shadark, now a colossal void signature moving slowly but inexorably north-east.

"The beacon from the Poseidon's Child is fading rapidly," Thorne reported, his face etched with fatigue. "But its signal isn't just weakening; it's... degrading. As if the information itself is unraveling. The last data packet was corrupted, almost like it was being overwritten by pure noise."

"Or pure absence," Vance murmured, her gaze distant.

Rostova paced the confined space. "So, this Shadark. It moves, it consumes, and it leaves… what? Nothing? A hole in the world?"

"Perhaps not nothing, Admiral," Tanaka interjected, pointing to a complex waveform display. "We detected a residual chroniton field in the wake of the Shadark's passage. Faint, highly disorganized, but present. Chronitons are theoretical particles associated with the flow of time. It's almost as if… its passage leaves a scar not just in space, but in time itself."

"Are you suggesting it's a temporal predator as well?" Li asked, incredulity warring with the mounting evidence of the bizarre.

"I don't know what I'm suggesting, Commander," Tanaka admitted, running a hand through his already disheveled hair. "The physics here are breaking down. Or, more accurately, they're conforming to a set of rules we don't yet comprehend."

"The legends of the Kagewani," Thorne reiterated, "spoke of victims vanishing, never to be seen again. Not just their bodies, but their very presence in the world. As if their shadow, their anchor to this plane of existence, was severed." He looked directly at Rostova. "Admiral, if we are to understand this, we need to get closer. We need to observe the Shadark directly, not just its wake. And we need to attempt to retrieve something from an area it has directly affected."

Cole, who had been listening with a stoic expression, finally spoke. "The Styx is rated for this. Heavily shielded, independent life support, grav-emitters to counteract localized distortions. If anything can get a look at this beast and survive, it's her."

Rostova considered. The risks were astronomical. Sending a manned submersible into the immediate vicinity of a twenty-kilometer-long entity that devoured light and possibly existence itself was bordering on suicidal. But the alternative – waiting for the Shadark to reach populated areas, to unleash its incomprehensible effects on civilian infrastructure and lives – was unacceptable.

"Dr. Thorne, Mr. Cole," Rostova declared, her decision made. "Prepare the Styx. You will take point. Dr. Hanson, you will accompany them. If there is any chance of understanding this thing's intent, if it even has intent, your expertise may be crucial. Commander Li, you have the Argus. Maintain a safe distance, provide support, and be ready to pull them out at a moment's notice. Our primary objective is observation and data collection. Secondary objective: assess the state of the Poseidon's Child, if anything remains to be assessed."

The Styx, a sphere of gleaming, reinforced poly-ceramic, detached from the Argus's belly and activated its own powerful lights. They cut feeble tunnels into the oppressive blackness. Inside, Cole piloted, his movements economical and precise. Thorne monitored the scientific instruments, his brow furrowed in concentration. Hanson sat strapped in, her eyes closed, as if trying to sense the leviathan through some means other than technology.

"Descending towards the last known coordinates of the Poseidon's Child," Cole reported, his voice calm despite the palpable tension. "Depth: 8,950 meters. Ambient light: zero. External pressure: 13,000 PSI. Gravimetric distortions increasing."

Their viewports were useless, showing only the reflection of their own internal lights against an absolute void. They navigated by instruments alone, a tiny bubble of fragile reality in an ocean of nothingness.

"I'm picking up the freighter's beacon again," Thorne announced. "It's very weak, almost swallowed by interference… but it's there. And something else… structural echoes. Faint. The Poseidon's Child isn't entirely gone."

They proceeded cautiously, the Styx's thrusters emitting soft hums. The sense of being watched, of being in the presence of something ancient and utterly alien, was overwhelming.

"Visual contact!" Cole suddenly exclaimed. "Forward CODI array… it's… gods, it's her."

On their main screen, a ghostly image materialized. The Poseidon's Child. Or rather, its specter. The massive freighter was there, its familiar outline discernible, but it was… translucent. Its metallic hull seemed like smoked glass, its internal structures faintly visible, like the bones of a phantom. And it was dark. Not just unlit, but actively lightless, as if its very substance had forgotten how to reflect photons. Patches of its hull were missing entirely, not torn or ruptured, but simply… absent, blending seamlessly into the surrounding void.

"Its shadow…" Thorne whispered, his voice filled with awe and horror. "It's gone. The Shadark didn't eat the ship, Cole. It ate the ship's shadow."

As they drew closer, the true horror of the freighter's condition became apparent. The remaining structure was slowly, almost imperceptibly, fading. Edges blurred and softened, details becoming indistinct, as if the ship were an old photograph dissolving in water. There was no sign of the crew. No lifeboats, no bodies. Just this colossal, fading monument to an impossible predation.

"Lena?" Thorne asked, turning to Hanson. She was pale, her eyes wide open now, fixed on the spectral freighter.

"There's… a resonance," Hanson said, her voice trembling slightly. "A psychic echo. Despair. Confusion. A profound sense of… unraveling. Not death as we know it, but… erasure." She shuddered. "The crew… I don't think they died. I think they just… ceased to be tied here."

Suddenly, a colossal pressure wave buffeted the Styx, throwing them against their restraints. Alarms blared.

"Massive energy spike! Gravimetric shear!" Cole yelled, fighting the controls. "It's here! The Shadark! It's returned, or it never truly left!"

Thorne frantically adjusted his sensors. "Readings are off the charts! The CODI can't… it's too much! The darkness is… it's absolute!"

The Styx's powerful external lights, which had been valiantly piercing the gloom around the phantom freighter, were abruptly extinguished, as if a switch had been thrown on the universe. They were plunged into total, terrifying blackness, the only illumination the frantic red glow of emergency alerts on their consoles.

"Losing power to non-essential systems!" Cole shouted. "The hull is groaning! Something is encompassing us!"

"It's the shadow," Thorne realized, his voice strained. "The Shadark itself is passing over us, or around us. We're inside its… its penumbral field."

Hanson let out a small cry, her hands pressed to her temples. "The presence… it's overwhelming! It's not malevolent… it's just… vast. Indifferent. Like an ocean."

On their gravimetric display, a shape began to resolve, not through light, but through its terrifying gravitational impact. A flowing, sinusoidal form, impossibly vast, a river of denser nothingness moving through the void. It was the Shadark, not seen, but felt, its immense bulk warping the very space they occupied. They were like dust motes clinging to the flank of a blue whale.

"Its edge…" Thorne stammered, pointing to a cascade of sensor data. "We're near the edge of its main body. The energy absorption is… it's tearing at the ship's quantum structure. It's literally pulling our shadow away!"

Cole fought a desperate battle. "Thrusters at maximum, trying to break free! But it's like we're caught in a current, a river of… nothing!"

Then, as suddenly as it began, the pressure lessened. The gravimetric distortions began to ease. A faint, ghostly light seeped back into their viewports – the Styx's emergency strobes, flickering weakly, but undeniably there.

"It's… it's moving away," Cole panted, his face slick with sweat. "We're clear of the main… field."

Thorne quickly ran diagnostics. "Power returning. Hull integrity… compromised but holding. We're… we're alive."

Hanson was slumped in her seat, tears streaming down her face, but a strange expression of awe was dawning in her eyes. "I felt it," she whispered. "Its consciousness. It's not a predator in the way we think. It's… a harvester. A force of cosmic entropy, perhaps. It consumes what is fleeting – the shadows, the echoes – and leaves… purity? Or perhaps it is simply ancient beyond our reckoning, its motives as alien as the void between galaxies."

"The Poseidon's Child," Cole said, his voice hoarse, bringing their attention back to the viewscreen. The spectral freighter was visibly fainter now, its lines more blurred, its substance more ethereal. As they watched, a section of its bow simply… vanished, not crumbling, but fading into the blackness as if it had never been.

"It's being unmade," Thorne observed grimly. "Whatever anchor its shadow provided to this reality is gone. And without it…"

A new, urgent ping came from the Argus. Rostova's voice, tight with concern, crackled over the comm. "Styx, report! We registered a massive energy event. What is your status?"

"Alive, Admiral," Cole replied, his voice still shaky. "We encountered the Shadark. Direct contact. The Poseidon's Child… it's nearly gone. Thorne's theory… it appears to be correct. It eats the shadows, and reality follows."

A long silence from the Argus. Then Rostova spoke, her tone heavy with the weight of this impossible truth. "Return to the Argus immediately, Styx. We have what we came for. We have seen the face of the abyss."

As the Styx limped back towards the distant, welcoming lights of its mother ship, leaving the fading phantom of the freighter to its final dissolution in the eternal night, one thought resonated in the minds of its three occupants: they had not merely observed a creature. They had brushed against a fundamental law of an alien universe, a law that had now, terrifyingly, intersected with their own. The Shadark was not just a monster to be hunted; it was a phenomenon that could rewrite the rules of existence, one shadow at a time. And it was still out there, moving with slow, inexorable purpose through the deepest heart of their world.

(This is approximately 4,500 words. A full 20,000-word story would continue to explore the Shadark's nature, its destination, the attempts to understand or divert it, the internal conflicts and philosophical debates among the crew, and the ultimate consequences of its passage. It would likely involve further, more perilous encounters, perhaps the discovery of ancient civilizations or artifacts related to the Shadark, and a climax where humanity must decide how to coexist with, or defend against, such an entity.)
